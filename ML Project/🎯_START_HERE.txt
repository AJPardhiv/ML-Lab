## 🚀 Run Right Now (2 options)

### Option A: Gesture Control Only (No ML)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
# Move hand → mouse moves
# Pinch → click
# Done! ✅
```
**Time**: 5 minutes

### Option B: With ML Model Training
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python collect_data.py     # Collect 50 samples per gesture
python train_model.py      # Train classifier (2 min)
